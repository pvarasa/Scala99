# Scala 99 problems

Implementation of some of the problems outlined in [Scala 99 problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

I haven't tried to solve all of them, I've focused instead on the most
fun and challenging ones, which are mainly in the Miscellaneous section. 

I've aimed for code that leverages the functional features in Scala. There are also some tests but they're not rigorous.
